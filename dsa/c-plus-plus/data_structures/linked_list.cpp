/**
 * @file
 * @brief Implementation of singly linked list algorithm.
 * @details
 * The linked list is a data structure used for holding a sequence of
 * values, which can be added, removed and displayed.
 * ### Algorithm
 * Values can be added by iterating to the end of a list(by following
 * the pointers) starting from the first link. Whichever link points to null
 * is considered the last link and is pointed to the new value.
 *
 * Values can be removed by also iterating through the list. When the node
 * containing the value is found, the node pointing to the current node is made
 * to point to the node that the current node is pointing to, and then returning
 * the current node to heap store.
